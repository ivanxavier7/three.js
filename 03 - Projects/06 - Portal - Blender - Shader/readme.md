Before doing uv unwrapping or exporting the model we must see if the textures are correctly turned, otherwise we have to flip them

Top right corner, two balls, enable face orientation filter

Next we must select everything, control A and stabilize the scale, only now can we start unwrapping

When unwrapping we can say where we are going to start opening the geometry with: u -> mark seam
