Before doing uv unwrapping or exporting the model we must see if the textures are correctly turned, otherwise we have to flip them.

Top right corner, two balls, enable `Face Orientation` filter.

Next we must select everything, control A and stabilize the scale, only now can we start unwrapping:

* `A` + `A` -> `Scale`

When unwrapping we can say where we are going to start opening the geometry with:

* `U` -> `Mark Seam`
